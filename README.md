# SecureChat2
An redesign of SecureChat with similarities to modern instant messaging services.

## Work in Progress
This program is still in its early stages. Most of the underlying features are complete, but the client interface currently lacks ways to interact with some of them. More importantly, some potential insecureties have yet to be dealt with (e.g. handling of invalid messages).

## Description
I'm hoping I'll get around to explaining how this program works soon. It implements many of the feature requests I received from users of [0x00sec.org](0x00sec.org). If you liked the original SecureChat, I know you'll be interested in SecureChat2.
